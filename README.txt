This mod is free for download, editing, distribution, and anything else permitted by the MIT license. I politely request that if I am active in the SDV community, that deference to running the mod and its necessary updates be given to myself, unless I am unable or unwilling to make necessary updates.

In the event that I have not been active on the chucklefish forums, Nexus Mods, or SDV public discord for at least 30 days, I give explicit permission for any willing SDV modder to fork, modify and distribute code from this repository.

In the event a new SDV and/or SMAPI version is released that breaks compatibility of my mods, the inactivity duration only needs to be 7 days for the above permission to be valid.

I ask that should I return after such a time, that the person who was kind enough to take over maintenance of my mods return them to myself.
